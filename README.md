React Login Page with Background Video

This project is a React-based login page featuring a dynamic background video. The login form is styled for a modern and clean look, and the background video adds visual appeal with smooth playback and a fade-out effect.

Features:

Login Form: A responsive login form with fields for username and password.
Background Video: A moving background video that plays in the background with a fade-out effect when it ends.

Responsive Design: The page is designed to be mobile-friendly and centered on the screen.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine. You can download them from nodejs.org.

How It Works

The background video, shot by my little sister, plays with a slow playback rate for a smooth visual experience.
A fade-out animation is applied to the video when it ends, enhancing the transition effect.
The login form is styled with modern CSS to ensure a clean and user-friendly interface.
